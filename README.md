# YunoJuno React Code Test

## Task

In this repository, there is a simple React app. Currently this app doesn't do a whole lot of much. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to add some functionality to the app, fulfilling the following user stories:

* As a user I can
  - see a list of Lord of the Rings characters
  - filter this list by selecting a category, and see only relevant results
  - order the list alphabetically or by what page they first appear

In service of these user stories, there are some additional requirements:

* Your solution must have some test coverage
* Your solution should be styled appropriately (based on design provided)

All the assets necessary (including a JSON file with all the required data) are included in the repository.

The test should be completable within a few hours, but there is no strict time limit.

## Tools

The app was prepared using `react-create-app`. You can run the app using `npm start` or `yarn start`. If you require more info, please refer to the `react-create-app` docs @ [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app].

`react-create-app` supports ES6 syntax.
